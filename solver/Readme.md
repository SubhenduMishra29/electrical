## Project Overview

Youâ€™re building a power flow analysis system, which involves several components:
1. **Bus Class**: Represents the buses in the power system with properties and methods for voltage, power injections, connected buses, generators, and loads.
2. **Line Structure**: Represents transmission lines connecting the buses.
3. **Jacobian Structure**: Represents the Jacobian matrix used in the Newton-Raphson method for solving power flow.
4. **Power Flow Calculation**: Functions to calculate power mismatches and solve the power flow using methods like Newton-Raphson.

## Implemented Components

1. **Bus Class (`bus.h`, `bus.cpp`)**: Complete with properties, methods, and calculations for total load and generation.
2. **Power Flow Header (`powerflow.h`)**: Declarations for power flow calculation functions.
3. **Supporting Definitions (`line.h`, `jacobian.h`)**: Structures for lines and the Jacobian matrix.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement `powerflow.cpp`**: The logic for calculating mismatches and solving the power flow.
2. **Test with `main.cpp`**: A main function to create a small system, run power flow, and verify the results.

## Points to Clarify

1. **Existing Code**: What parts of the code have you already implemented beyond what's shown above?
2. **Specific Questions or Issues**: Are there specific areas where you need help or clarification?
3. **Desired Functionality**: Any additional functionality or specific requirements for the power flow analysis?
